# Safe Watcher

This repository contains a bot that monitors one or more Safe addresses for critical activities throughout the entire transaction lifecycle:

- **Adding Transactions:** Detects when new transactions are created in the Safe.
- **Signing Transactions:** Monitors who signs the transactions and how many signatures have been collected.
- **Executing Transactions:** Sends alerts when a transaction is executed.

Additionally, the bot watches for any suspicious `delegateCall`. If a `delegateCall` is directed to an address other than the trusted `MultiSend` contract, the bot immediately flags it, helping to prevent attacks similar to the Bybit hack.

Real-time alerts are sent to a configured Telegram channel for immediate notification.

## Usage

To get started, create a `config.yaml` file with your settings. Refer to [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) and [schema.ts](src/config/schema.ts) for guidance.

Run the Docker container with your config file mounted:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml ghcr.io/gearbox-protocol/safe-watcher:latest
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `config.yaml` file in your local directory. You can look at [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) and [schema.ts](src/config/schema.ts) for details. Here is an example structure:

   ```yaml
   telegramBotToken: "xxxx"
   telegramChannelId: "-1111"
   safeAddresses:
     - "eth:0x11111"
   signers:
     "0x22222": "alice"
     "0x33333": "bob"
   ```

   - **telegramBotToken:** Your Telegram Bot API token (instructions below).
   - **telegramChannelId:** The ID of the channel or group where alerts will be posted.
   - **safeAddresses:** One or more Safe addresses to monitor, prefixed by the network identifier (e.g., `eth:` for the Ethereum mainnet).
   - **signers:** A mapping of addresses to descriptive names (useful for labeling owners in alerts).

2. Ensure that `config.yaml` is in the same directory where you plan to run the Docker container.

### Getting a Telegram Bot Token

1. Open the Telegram app and start a chat with `@BotFather`.
2. Type `/start` if you haven't used BotFather before.
3. Send the command `/newbot` and follow the prompts:
   - Provide a name for your bot (display name).
   - Provide a username for your bot (it must end in "bot", e.g., `MySafeNotifierBot`).
4. Once the bot is created, BotFather will provide you with an HTTP API token (e.g., `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`).
5. Copy this token and use it as the value for `telegramBotToken` in your `config.yaml`.

### Getting a Telegram Channel ID

1. Create a new channel or group in Telegram.
2. Invite your bot to the channel.
3. Send a message to the channel.
4. Use getUpdates (Testing Locally or Anywhere You Can Send HTTP Requests)

- Make a call to the [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) endpoint of the Bot API using your bot token. For example: https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates

The response is a JSON that contains “messages,” “channel_posts,” “callback_query,” or similar objects, depending on how your bot receives interactions.

5. Parse the JSON

- Look for the `"chat"` object inside each message (e.g., `"message"` or `"edited_message"`).
- The `"chat": { "id": ... }` field is the chat ID. For example, a response might look like:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": 123456789,
      "message": {
        "message_id": 12,
        "from": {
          ...
        },
        "chat": {
          "id": 987654321,
          "first_name": "John",
          "type": "private"
        },
        "date": 1643212345,
        "text": "Hello"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this snippet, 987654321 is the telegramChannelId.
.

### Running via Docker

Run the Docker container with your config file mounted using the following command:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml ghcr.io/gearbox-protocol/safe-watcher:latest
```

The bot will start and immediately begin monitoring the specified Safe addresses. Any relevant changes or suspicious `delegateCall` attempts will be sent to your Telegram channel.
